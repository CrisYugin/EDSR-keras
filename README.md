# EDSR-keras
Keras implementation of EDSR: Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution

## Data processing  
You can modify and run data_process.py to create your own datasets. Then run imgs_to_npy.py to transfer all images to .npy files as train set. Remember to modify the path of images to your own.  

## Train  
python train_EDSR.py

## Test  
python test.py
